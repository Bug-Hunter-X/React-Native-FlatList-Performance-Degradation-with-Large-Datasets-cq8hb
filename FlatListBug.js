This React Native bug manifests when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex render items.  The issue arises from inefficient rendering and re-renders, leading to performance degradation and UI freezes.  The problem is exacerbated when using dynamic data updates or frequent list scrolling. The `keyExtractor` function is not properly implemented leading to incorrect component identification during updates.
