# React Native FlatList Performance Bug

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with large datasets and complex item rendering.  The bug is characterized by significant performance degradation, including UI freezes and slow scrolling, especially when the list is updated frequently.  The root cause lies in inefficient re-rendering and improper use of the `keyExtractor` function.

## Bug Reproduction

The `FlatListBug.js` file contains the problematic implementation. Running this code with a large dataset will reproduce the performance issue.

## Solution

The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that addresses the performance problems.  The solution uses techniques to optimize rendering and ensure correct key extraction, resulting in a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Key Improvements

*   **Efficient Key Extraction:** Correct implementation of `keyExtractor` to ensure unique keys for each item. This prevents unnecessary re-rendering.
*   **Memoization:** Using `useMemo` to cache expensive calculations and prevent redundant computation.
*   **Item Optimization:**  Simplification of the item rendering logic to reduce rendering overhead.

This example highlights the importance of using `FlatList` efficiently, especially with complex data.  Properly implementing key extraction and optimizing rendering are crucial for maintaining application performance.
